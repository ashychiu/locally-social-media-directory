More and More people have started a side hustle during the pandemic, for examples - home baked goods, mobile salon, dog walking, cleaning service etc. Most of them are social media based - they have an Instragram or Facebook page but don't have the capacity to advertise themselves and potential clients may not know where to find a mobile hair dresser or dog groomer other than the century old "word of mouth".
